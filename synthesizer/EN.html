            <h4>Exploring sonic cartography</h4>
            <h3>In a world where the emphasis on visual data is ever-growing, the project's main aim is to contribute to the small but growing field of cartophony; <b>exploring sonic methods for the mapping of spatial environments</b>. In the context of the Mapping Project's collaboration with Munich's Pfennigparade, we pay special attention to the sense of <b>listening as an under-explored means of communicating spatial information</b>. Taking the perspective of <b>visually-impaired people</b> as our starting point, the result is an app, <b>Synthesizer</b>, which <b>synthesizes topological, spatial features into sound</b>.</h3>
            <h3>The app was built merging several creative- and tech-based tools and sources, namely: <br>
            - Geo-information: OpenStreetMap <br>
            - Sound/voice composition: Ableton, Audacity, TTSMP3.com, freesound.org <br>
            - Software coding/programming: ReactNative, Expo <br>
            <br>
            Spatial data was selected from OpenStreetMap to map specific test areas, with in-built mobile geo-tech (e.g. GPS and phone orientation) utilized to create a user-centered spatial experience. Sound typology attribution was mainly adopted from previous studies. Specific sound samples were collected from field-recordings and Ableton plug-in libraries.</h3>
